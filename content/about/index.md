The **Harambee Cultural Society** is a Canadian non-profit organization dedicated to supporting children of African heritage and their families — including biological, adoptive, and foster parents.

We recognize that raising Black children in families of all kinds can involve unique joys and challenges. Our programs, gatherings, and annual **Summer Festival** are designed to provide cultural connection, build community, and strengthen families through shared learning and support.

At Harambee, we believe that children thrive when they feel seen, celebrated, and supported in their racial and cultural identities.

## Our Purpose

Our purpose is to support the well-being of children of African heritage by:

- Creating a safe space for children to explore their identity, culture, and community.  
- Providing parents and caregivers with tools and support to navigate race, identity, and attachment.  
- Reducing isolation by building strong, interconnected communities of families.  
- Celebrating Black culture and affirming the lived experiences of Black children in Canada.  
- Encouraging lifelong learning for children, parents, and extended family members.
