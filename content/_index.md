{{< hero-pane title="Welcome to Harambee" >}}

Harambee began in **1996**, when two families raising children of African heritage came together around a campfire — sharing stories, laughter, and a deep desire for connection. From those humble beginnings, a vibrant and growing community was born.

Today, we proudly support **all children of African heritage** from across the country and continent — regardless of family type (*biological, adoptive, or foster*) — through our flagship event, the **Harambee Summer Festival**, and year-round educational programming.

At the heart of our work is a shared commitment to **children’s joy, identity, and connection** — celebrating Black culture and empowering families through meaningful, shared experience.

Our **week-long summer festival** provides a joyful, culturally rooted, and safe space where children and families can explore identity together, build lasting friendships, and grow as a community.

## Key Values

### Safe, Secure, Engaging & Fun
All children of African heritage — including those in biological, foster, or adoptive families — are welcome to explore and better understand their identity, race, and belonging in a warm, supportive environment.

### Learning and Teaching Together
We offer educational workshops, seminars, and gatherings that bring children, parents, caregivers, and community together.  
Our goal is to deepen understanding of **identity**, **attachment**, and the experiences of Black children in **transracial**, **foster**, **adoptive**, and **biological** families.

### Building Community
We foster connections and understanding within families of African heritage, and between these families and the broader community.  
Through shared experiences, we strengthen relationships and reduce isolation.

### Strengthening Families
Our family enrichment programs are rooted in the real-life experiences and cultural identities of Black children — whether they are in biological, adoptive, or foster families.  
Through **workshops, peer connection, cultural programming, and shared learning**, we support families in navigating their unique journeys — and growing together in **confidence, joy, and belonging**.
