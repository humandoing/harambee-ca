# Donate

For nearly **30 years**, Harambee Cultural Society has built a safe, joyful, and culturally grounded community for families raising children of African heritage.

At the heart of this work is the **Harambee Summer Festival** — a one-of-a-kind, week-long cultural camp where families connect, children thrive, and heritage is celebrated through music, storytelling, play, and shared experience.

Your donations make it possible to:

- Offer cultural, artistic, and heritage-based activities for children and youth  
- Provide workshops, counselling, and expert-led sessions for parents and caregivers  
- Support mentorship and leadership opportunities for youth and young adults  
- Keep Harambee affordable for families who need financial support to attend
